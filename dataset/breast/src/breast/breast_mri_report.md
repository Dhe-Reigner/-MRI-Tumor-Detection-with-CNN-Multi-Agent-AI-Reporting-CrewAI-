### Breast MRI Diagnostic Report
#### Summary
A breast MRI was performed to evaluate the presence of a tumor in the imaged breast tissue. The tumor detection model has produced a probability estimate of 0.5016, indicating a borderline or equivocal result. This finding is considered indeterminate or suspicious, and further evaluation is recommended to determine the presence or absence of a malignancy.

#### Tumor Likelihood
The tumor likelihood is estimated to be 50.16%, which falls into a gray zone where the model is not strongly convinced of the presence or absence of a tumor. This result is considered uncertain and requires integration with other clinical and imaging findings to guide patient care.

#### Confidence Level
The confidence level of this result is low, as the prediction probability falls within the specified range of 0.4 to 0.6. This indicates that the model is not sufficiently confident in its prediction, and therefore, the result should be flagged as uncertain.

#### Medical Disclaimer
This report is not intended to be a definitive diagnosis, but rather a probability estimate that requires further evaluation and review by a radiologist. The result should be considered in conjunction with other clinical and imaging findings to determine the presence or absence of a tumor. A radiologist will carefully review the entire MRI study, including all imaging sequences and patient history, to provide a more definitive interpretation and recommend the next appropriate steps in management. Additional imaging sequences, comparison with prior exams, or a biopsy may be necessary to determine the presence or absence of a malignancy.
